A contemporary sans serif design, Arial contains more humanist characteristics than many of its predecessors and as such is more in tune with the mood of the last decades of the twentieth century. The overall treatment of curves is softer and fuller than in most industrial-style sans serif faces. Terminal strokes are cut on the diagonal which helps to give the face a less mechanical appearance. Arial is an extremely versatile family of typefaces which can be used with equal success for text setting in reports, presentations, magazines etc, and for display use in newspapers, advertising and promotions.",

Diagonal and vertical hairlines and serifs are relatively strong, while horizontal serifs are small and intend to emphasize stroke endings rather than stand out themselves. This principle is most noticeable in the italics where the lowercase characters are subdued in style to be at their best as elements of word-images. When Cambria is used for captions at sizes over 20 point, the  inter-character spacing should be slightly reduced for best results. The design isn't just intended for business documents: The regular weight has been extended with a large set of math and science symbols. The Greek and Cyrillic has been designed under close supervision of an international team of experts, who aimed to set a historical new standard in multi-script type design.",

It is wider and heavier than Century Expanded, there is also less contrast between thick and thin strokes. First cut by Monotype in 1934 and based on versions from ATF and Lanston Monotype. The sturdy nature of this typeface, coupled with its inherent legibility, has made it a popular choice for setting books, newspapers and magazines.",

In 1979, under license from ATF, ITC developed four new weights in roman and italic: book, medium, demi and heavy. Designed by Victor Caruso, ITC’s new weights matched the original face’s characteristics, but featured a slightly enlarged lowercase x-height. ITC Franklin Gothic also features a slightly condensed lowercase a-z alphabet. In 1991, ITC commissioned the Font Bureau in Boston to create condensed, compressed and extra compressed versions of ITC Franklin Gothic, which increased the flexibility and usefulness of the design.",

The italic is based on types cut in France circa 1557 by Robert Granjon. Garamond is a beautiful typeface with an air of informality which looks good in a wide range of applications.

This influenced Gill who later experimented with sans serif designs, and in due course produced a set of capital letters. These became Monotype series 231, produced in 1923, and the forerunner of the extensive Gill Sans range now available. A twentieth century sans serif that has a simplicity of form which does not reject traditional forms and proportions, and gives the face a humanist feel. The lighter weights are highly readable in text and suitable for magazine and book work, whereas the heavier weights are best used for display in advertising, packaging, and labels.",

Schmalfette Grotesk was a very condensed, very bold alphabet of all capitals – schmalfette means \"bold condensed\" in German, and grotesk indicates it is without serifs.\r\nIt was immediately picked up by designers at Paris Match who cut up pictures of it to make headlines. Soon everybody wanted it. In due course, extra-bold extra-condensed faces for families like Helvetica began to appear, looking remarkably like the original Schmalfette. \r\nPhotoscript had made a lowercase version quite early on. Later, they made a less condensed version and called it Haettenschweiler Extended as a tribute to a designer whose idea so greatly affected the graphic scene in the second half of the century. Use this distinguished face in large sizes for headlines.\r\n",

    "description": "Lato is a sanserif typeface family designed in the Summer 2010 by Warsaw-based designer Lukasz Dziedzic (\"Lato\" means \"Summer\" in Polish). It tries to carefully balance some potentially conflicting priorities: it should seem quite \"transparent\" when used in body text but would display some original traits when used in larger sizes. The classical proportions, particularly visible in the uppercase, give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same time, its sleek sanserif look makes evident the fact that Lato was designed in 2010, even though it does not follow any current trend. The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness.",

The overall treatment of curves is softer and fuller than in most industrial style sans serif faces.  Terminal strokes are cut on the diagonal which helps to give the face a less mechanical appearance.  Arial is an extremely versatile family of typefaces which can be used with equal success for text setting in reports, presentations, magazines etc, and for display use in newspapers, advertising and promotions.",

    "description": "The Maiandra family of typefaces were inspired by an early example of Oswald Cooper's hand-lettering, as seen in an advertisement for a book on home furnishing, circa 1909. Although many of Oz Cooper's letterform designs were cast in metal type, this particular one was not. \r\n\r\nThe weights for the Maiandra family were selected for their versatility in usage over a broad range of output device resolutions. Indeed, \"the consideration of eventual display resolutions, be they for screen or printer, provided the greatest challenge in the design of this typeface family,\" explains Dennis. Creating shapes that conform to the rigors of digital letterforms and modern rendering environments, without losing the unique characteristics of Oz Cooper's original design, is what Dennis has accomplished with his tribute to this great designer of the past. \r\n\r\nMaiandra, whose name derives from the Greek 'maiandros', meaning 'meander,' is intended for extended text use, as well as for informal subject matter, such as business correspondence, brochures and broadsides. \"An example of a good use for Maiandra,\" notes Dennis, \"is in printed matter relating to the turn-of-the-century art period known as the Arts and Crafts Movement. It can stand alone or be used with designs that complement its shape and color.\"",

Please read this Agreement before purchasing, downloading, installing or using the Font Package Software (?Font Package?).  By purchasing, downloading, installing, or using this font package, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.   \n\n\r\n\r\n1. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  The receipt that accompanies each purchase or download of a Font Package from Magpie Paper Works (?Foundry?) is made part of this Agreement as though fully stated herein.  This Agreement, in conjunction with the receipt that accompanies each purchase from Magpie Paper Works (\"Foundry\"), constitutes the entire agreement between you and Foundry and supersedes any prior proposals, agreements or understandings between you and Foundry.\r\n\r\n\n\n2. APPLICABILITY.  This Agreement applies to all Font Packages offered by Foundry, whether the Font Package is offered free of charge or offered for sale.\n\n\r\n\r\n3. GRANT OF LICENSE.  This Agreement grants you a license to use the Font Package and does not transfer any other right, title or interest in or to the Font Package, the font itself, or the characters making up the font.  Except as otherwise stated herein, the license granted entitles you to perpetual, nonexclusive, and unlimited non-commercial use of the Font Package.  This license entitles you to limited commercial use of this Font Package as further described herein. If you have any doubt as to whether a particular use of this software is permitted or prohibited by this Agreement, please contact Magpie Paper Works by emailing licensing@magpiepaperworks.com for more information or to request a supplemental license. We will do our best to accommodate your specific circumstances with a supplemental license if we determine it to be necessary.\r\n\r\n\n\n4. NUMBER OF USERS/INSTALLATIONS.  The maximum number of simultaneous users of the Font Package allowed under this license is specified in the applicable receipt. If the number of users is not specified on the receipt, then the maximum number of simultaneous users permitted is one.  All users of the Font Package must belong to the same company, organization, or household as the person obtaining this license.  \n\nIn no event may any single user install the Font Package on more than 2 devices.  In the event a single user installs the Font Package on two devices, then the Font Package on those two devices may not be utilized simultaneously unless such use fully complies with this Agreement, including but not limited to the terms of this paragraph concerning the maximum number of simultaneous users permitted and requiring that all simultaneous users belong to the same company, organization or household as the person obtaining this license.  Under no circumstances may the Font Package be served to a user over a network, LAN, WAN, or the internet.   Such use requires a special license that may only be obtained by contacting Foundry as instructed in Paragraph 3 of this Agreement.\n\nYou agree to inform all authorized users or other persons having access to the Font Package and any copies of the Font Package of this Agreement and ensure that they strictly abide by the terms and conditions thereof. \n\nIn addition to the number of installations provided for in this paragraph, you may make up to one copy of the Font Package on a storage device exclusively for purposes of back-up, provided that you agree to retain exclusive custody and control over the back-up copy. Any back-up copy that you make must carry the same copyright and trademark notices displayed on the original. Upon termination of this Agreement, you must destroy the original and any and all copies of the Font Package. Unauthorized sharing, lending, renting, sale or other unauthorized use, misuse or transfer of back-up copy is prohibited.\n\n\r\n\r\n5. THIRD PARTIES.    You may provide the Font Package to a graphic designer, printer or other such organizations or persons working on your behalf only if such third parties agree to use the Font Package exclusively for your work, agree to the terms of this license, and retain no copies of the font on completion of the work.  You may not provide the Font Package or make it accessible to any other third parties. You may not re-sell, sublicense, lease, lend, rent, give away, or otherwise transfer the Font Package or its documentation.\n\n\r\n\r\n6. MODIFICATIONS.  You may import characters from the Font Package as graphical objects into a drawing program and modify such graphical objects. Any modified objects remain subject to this Agreement. You may convert characters from the Font Package to another format. The converted version of those characters will remain subject to the terms of this Agreement.  You may not re-sell, sublicense, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on the licensed font without Foundry's prior written consent.\n\n\r\n\r\n7. EMBEDDING.   You may embed characters from the Font Package into any document you send to third parties. Such documents may be viewed and printed (but not edited) by the recipients.  You may not under any circumstances embed characters from the Font Package into software or hardware products in which the Font Package will be used by the purchasers of such products, or from which the Font Package can be extracted or transmitted. Examples of such products may include but are not limited to electronic books or magazines, mobile applications, gaming consoles or electronic games, embroidering or sewing machines, etc.  Such use requires a supplemental license that may only be obtained by contacting Foundry as instructed in Paragraph 3 of this Agreement.\n\n\r\n\r\n8.  PERMITTED USES.  Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, the commercial or non-commercial purposes for which you may use the Font Package include, but are not limited to, the following, which are provided strictly for purposes of clarity:\r\n\r\n\n\nA. To create images on paper, web pages, photographs, T-shirts, and other tangible surfaces or electronic displays so long as the image is a fixed size and non-editable;\r\n\r\nB. To create EPS files or other scalable drawings provided that such files are only used by the household, organization, or company licensing the font and otherwise comply with this Agreement; \n\n\r\n\r\nC. To create logos provided the characters from the Font Package are translated to artwork outlines; \r\n\r\nD. For broadcast television, internet, video and/or film usage, titling, credits or other forms of attribution provided that the use does not permit interactive \"typesetting,\" print out for use on goods or products, or any other use, transmission or extraction of the Font Package by the user or viewer of the broadcast, video or film.\n\n\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATIONS ON COMMERCIAL USE.  Certain commercial uses (whether for profit or not-for-profit) are not permitted without the purchase of a supplemental license.  Such licenses are issued at the sole discretion of the Foundry. Those commercial uses not permitted by this Agreement include the following:\n\n\r\n\r\nA. Point of sale displays;\r\n\n\r\n\nB.

    "description": "The typeface was designed at ParaType (ParaGraph) in 1989-2004 by Vladimir Yefimov and Olga Chaeva. A spin-off from Encyclopedia-4 type family of the Polygraphmash type design bureau (1987, Vladimir Yefimov and Isay Slutsker). Inspired by Helvetica (Neue Haas Grotesk) of Haas typefoundry, 1957 by Eduard Hoffman and Max Miedinger. Based on the 19th century Grotesque designs, Helvetica brought a new level of mathematical accuracy to the sans serif category. Widely used for many applications, from magazines and books to advertising and headlines. 4 basic styles of Pragmatica were developed in 1989 by Vladimir Yefimov. Eight additional styles were developed in 2003 by Olga Chaeva. Condensed styles were developed in 1993-2004 by Vladimir Yefimov, Alexander Tarbeev and Manvel Shmavonyan, with participation of Dmitry Kirsanov. Extended styles were developed in 2004 by Olga Chaeva and Manvel Shmavonyan.",

    "description": "Robusta Pro is the work of a Latvian type designer Gustavs Grinbergs. It is a highly legible, modern sans serif typeface inspired by Edward Johnston's Railway Type and the research and theories of William Addison Dwiggins theories. Designed for ITDC contest in 2003, extended to OpenType in 2007, it has become a new variant for a workhorse font - with a modern, robust outlook. Typeface is available in broad range of width and weight variations allowing to be used both in tight not limited to headline and wide display contexts. Robusta Pro supports most Latin-based languages, small caps, ligatures, figure sets, fractions and ordinals, most of which are also functional via OpenType features. In 2012-2014 Robusta typeface was extended to Cyrillic and Greek scripts.",

    "description": "20th Century was designed and drawn by Sol Hess in the Lanston Monotype drawing office between 1936 and 1947. The first weights were added to the Monotype typeface library in 1959. This is a face based on geometric shapes which originated in Germany in the early 1920's and became an integral part of the Bauhaus movement of that time. Form and function became the key words, unnecessary decoration was scorned. This clean cut, sans serif with geometric shapes was most appropriate. The lighter weights can be used for text setting, the bold and condensed fonts are suitable for display in headlines and advertising.",

It then went through an extensive iterative process involving further work in Monotype's Type Drawing Office.  Based on experiments Morison had conducted using Perpetua and Plantin, it has many old style characteristics but was adapted to give excellent legibility coupled with good economy.  Widely used in books and magazines, for reports, office documents and also for display and advertising.",

    "description": "When Gerard Unger was doing the sketches for Capitolium, early in 1998, he considered proposing a sans serif for Rome based on the precursors of imperial Roman capitals. Few of these letters from the republican period have survived. They are partly geometrical, with circular Os, and have very little variation in thickness and very small serifs  really not much more than thorns. It was from these letters that sans serifs were developed at the end of the nineteenth century (see Mosley, J., The Nymph and the Grot. The Revival of the Sanserif Letter, London, 1999). However, the Agenzia romana per la preparazione del Giubileo decided that a seriffed type would be more suitable for Rome. In the end he took Vesta (named after the temple of Vesta at Tivoli, the ancestral home of all sans serifs) and developed it further on his own initiative. The Roman geometry has gone, there is now a slight difference between thick and thin, and the letters are narrower.",

Still appreciate if you did though.\n\nThe original design was used in the TV anime series Majo no Tabitabi by C2C.\nCopyright law doesn't protect typefaces, and I don't think they patterned this thing either. But just in case you are a schizo that really paranoid about legal right. You might want to consult your local lawyer before using this in your work, since copyright law does vary by country. \"Fair use\" and \"No copyright infringement intended\" won't save you in court.\n\nWith that being said, the Japanese isn't known for hunting down oversea copyright infringement offenders (yet), so you can rest assured that they aren't gonna sue you for something as trivial as this.\nAt the end of the day, everything is legal until you get caught.\n\nFun facts (I'm no lawyer, don't quote me on this):\n- In Japan, a work must express \"though or sentiment\" and must fall within the literary, scientific, artistic, or musical domain for it to be protected by copyright law. Typefaces function primarily as a means of communicating information; therefore, not copyrightable (although it might be decided on a case-by-case basis).\n- In the US, the shapes of typefaces are not eligible for copyright.\n- In Europe (namely the UK, Germany, France), they could sue you for every penny you've got.\n\nI've no idea why I spent a stupid amount of hours in my ever-shortening life researching about this stuff tho.\n\nBtw, since I first published this thing on a wiki powered by FANDOM service, it's technically available under CC-BY-SA license."

For this new digital version, Professor Zapf has drawn numerous additional characters to include an extensive range of ligatures, numerals, fractions and support for Cyrillic and both monotonic and polytonic Greek. Special care has been taken to enhance the quality of the letterforms when displayed on the computer screen, ensuring that Palatino Linotype is highly legible whether displayed on the screen or in print. This typeface is ideal for use in extended text settings such as books, periodicals and catalogs.",

    "description": "Adrian Frutiger designed Avenir in 1988, after years of having an interest in sans serif typefaces. In an interview with Linotype, he said he felt an obligation to design a linear sans in the tradition of Erbar and Futura, but to also make use of the experience and stylistic developments of the twentieth century. The word Avenir means 'future' in French and hints that the typeface owes some of its interpretation to Futura. But unlike Futura, Avenir is not purely geometric; it has vertical strokes that are thicker than the horizontals, an \"o\" that is not a perfect circle, and shortened ascenders. These nuances aid in legibility and give Avenir a harmonious and sensible appearance for both texts and headlines. In 2004 Adrian Frutiger and the type director of Linotype GmbH Akira Kobayashi reworked the Avenir and created the Avenir Next for the Platinum Collection. It includes new small caps, newly designed true italics, and a complete new range of condensed weights. Avenir Next is a versatile sans serif family, ready for large and complex projects from books to signage to advertising.",

This principle is most noticeable in the italics where the lowercase characters are subdued in style to be at their best as elements of word-images. When Cambria is used for captions at sizes over 20 point, the  inter-character spacing should be slightly reduced for best results. The design isn't just intended for business documents: The regular weight has been extended with a large set of math and science symbols.

    "description": "Lato is a sanserif typeface family designed in the Summer 2010 and extended in the Summer 2013 by Warsaw-based designer Lukasz Dziedzic (\"Lato\" means \"Summer\" in Polish). It tries to carefully balance some potentially conflicting priorities: it should seem quite \"transparent\" when used in body text but would display some original traits when used in larger sizes. The classical proportions, particularly visible in the uppercase, give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same time, its sleek sanserif look makes evident the fact that Lato was designed in the 2010s, even though it does not follow any current trend. The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. In 2013-2014, the family was greatly extended (with the help of Adam Twardoch and Botio Nikoltchev) to cover 3000+ glyphs over nine weights with italics. It now supports 100+ Latin-based languages, 50+ Cyrillic-based languages as well as Greek and IPA phonetics. The Lato fonts are available free of charge under the SIL Open Font License from http://www.latofonts.com/",
